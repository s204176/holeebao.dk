- **Golden Yellow Background**: Solid golden yellow background (#E8B84D) with Threads effect overlay
- **White Text**: Changed "Something Delicious" and subtitle to white for better visibility on golden background
- **Kept Steam Effect**: Logo steam particles still active (white steam rising from logo)
- **Fixed Steam Cutoff**: Removed overflow-hidden constraint, extended steam animation distance to -250px (from -150px), increased scale to 2x for smoother fluid effect
