# Claude Development Session Log

## Current Session: 2025-11-06

### Latest Changes (Scroll Experiment Branch)
- **NEW EXPERIMENTAL BRANCH**: `claude/scroll-experiment-011CUpog5k5x8axH97NZAj8B` - can easily revert back to main branch
- **Fixed Duplicate Steam**: Removed steam from landing page to avoid duplicate steam effect when scrolling between sections - only logo steam in section 2 remains
- **Enhanced Steam Effect**: Made steam bigger, more visible, and immediately active (20 particles, 50-110px size, 0.9 max opacity, negative delays for mid-cycle start)
- **Removed Opening Date**: Deleted "Estimated Opening Early 2026" section for cleaner design
- **Two-Section Scroll Design**:
  - Section 1: Minimal - just "Scroll to see what's steaming" text with gradual blur effect
  - Section 2: ALL conten3 at once (logo, tagline, COMING SOON, Instagram) with ScrollFloat effects
- **ScrollFloat Effects**: Parallax scroll effects on individual elements (logo, tagline, badge, button) with varying speeds and directions
- **Scroll Indicator**: Centered bouncing arrow (no duplicate text)
- **Gradual Blur Effect**: First section blurs as you scroll down
- **Fixed Threads Background**: Threads effect stays fixed while content scrolls
- **Threads Settings Optimized**: Set amplitude=0.6, distance=1 for subtler, more spread-out wavy threads effect
- **Threads WebGL Effect**: Added animated wavy threads overlay using OGL library - white threads that flow across the screen with mouse interaction
- **Typewriter Golden Glow**: Changed "is Steaming..." to white text with golden glow effect (visible on golden background while keeping the steaming aesthetic)
- **Golden Yellow Background**: Solid golden yellow background (#E8B84D) with Threads effect overlay
- **White Text**: Changed "Something Delicious" and subtitle to white for better visibility on golden background
- **Kept Steam Effect**: Logo steam particles still active (white steam rising from logo)
- **Fixed Steam Cutoff**: Removed overflow-hidden constraint, extended steam animation distance to -250px (from -150px), increased scale to 2x for smoother fluid effect
- **Removed Rotating Border Artifact**: Replaced rotating gradient border with static golden border (border-4 border-bao-golden) on COMING SOON badge
- **Epic COMING SOON Badge**: Dark gradient bg, pulsing glow, glowing gradient text, floating animation - clean and eye-catching!
- **Simplified IG Button**: Replaced big Instagram card with simple gradient button
- **Minimal Design**: Removed all extras (countdown, location, facts, visitor counter) - kept only logo, name, coming soon, IG button
